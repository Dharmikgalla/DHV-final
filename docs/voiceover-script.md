# Voiceover Script for Hierarchical Clustering Explainer

**Total Duration:** 90-120 seconds  
**Tone:** Warm, clear, professional, friendly, patient  
**Pace:** Slow, allowing time for comprehension

---

## Scene 0 — Hook (6-8s)

**Voiceover:**
"Imagine you have a big messy pile — how do you sort it so it makes sense?"

**Caption:**
"How do we group things so they make sense?"

---

## Scene 1 — Simple Analogy: Grouping by Similarity (12-15s)

**Voiceover:**
"We put things together that look alike. That's the idea behind clustering — grouping similar things."

**Caption:**
"Group similar items."

---

## Scene 2 — Introducing Hierarchical Idea (15-20s)

**Voiceover:**
"Sometimes we group small groups into bigger groups — like socks go into boxes, boxes into closets. That's hierarchical — groups inside groups, like a family tree."

**Caption:**
"Groups inside groups — a hierarchy."

---

## Scene 3 — What Hierarchical Clustering Does (20-25s)

**Voiceover:**
"In hierarchical clustering, we start with every item alone. Then we join the two most similar items. We keep joining groups until everything is one big group — and we record each join so we can see the whole family tree."

**Caption:**
"Start alone → join closest → build the tree."

---

## Scene 4 — Dendrogram Explained (15-20s)

**Voiceover:**
"That tree is called a dendrogram. If you draw a horizontal line through the tree, you'll see how many groups you want. Low line = many groups. High line = few groups."

**Caption:**
"Cut the tree to choose how many groups."

---

## Scene 5 — Real-World Examples (10-12s)

**Voiceover:**
"People use this to organize photos, find similar customers, or group animals by traits — anywhere you need to find natural groups."

**Caption:**
"Photos, shoppers, animals — all use clustering."

---

## Scene 6 — Why It's Helpful & Simple Summary (10-12s)

**Voiceover:**
"So hierarchical clustering helps us find groups, shows how groups relate, and lets you choose how many groups you want."

**Caption:**
"Find groups. See relationships. Choose granularity."

---

## Outro — Call to Action (6-8s)

**Voiceover:**
"Want to try? Use the interactive cards to see how grouping changes. It's like sorting socks — but for data."

**Caption & Button:**
"Try interactive cards →"

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
How do we group things so they make sense?

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Group similar items.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Groups inside groups — a hierarchy.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Start alone → join closest → build the tree.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Cut the tree to choose how many groups.

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Photos, shoppers, animals — all use clustering.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Find groups. See relationships. Choose granularity.

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,000
